## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Tagged `v0.1.0` as the first consumable release; portfolio apps now depend on groundwork via a
  pinned git dependency (see `docs/adr/0003-groundwork-distribution.md`). PyPI publication planned.

### Added
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` (Contributor Covenant 2.1) and a SECURITY.md vulnerability-reporting policy.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-21
### Added
- Engineering harness scaffold: governed doc set, config guard, verification gates,
  smoke test against a real business endpoint, migration-count check, CI pipeline,
  and a synthetic dataset so the demo runs with zero external keys.
